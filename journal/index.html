            <p>
                In this detailed rundown on the do's and don't's of overlay use, author Whitenton provides plenty of wonderful examples that help the reader understand her points. I am more of a visual learner, and her breakdown with graphics was very insightful and helpful. I had never considered the affordances of overlays on user experience. I do recognize alot of the points made in this article. I have noticed that many websites will interject overlays that promote their company/products, which in the long run is quite annoying when you are browsing between sites. I can see how meaningful overlay is important to consider when making your webpage. I appreciate that the article lists down the steps you can go through to recognize whether or not your webpage requires an overlay or not. Much more of these questions are prompted when the device used in question is a cell phone. The small screen size makes it a lot more imperative to decide whether or not an overlay would be distracting. In my future projects, I will focus on the who, what, when, where, and why of my overlay decisions.

            The article was very insightful. I never considered the small intricate details that affect user experience when filling out a form. In my personal experience filling out forms, I tend to like it when they're straightforward and concise. Gathering the data from the article and my own personal experience will help me with my form designs. Some surprising things that came from the article were the tips about passwords and placeholder text. I never really bat an eye when I have to fill out those parts of a form, but the article made me realize how a simple change to the interface can drastically change user experience. I have always been annoyed with typing out the password two times, so implementing a show/hide bar is something that should be more widely accepted and used. The placeholder tip is more intuitive, but slight changes like that has an obvious affect on the visuals of the page and comprehension of the user. A form I have interacted with that I found exemplified best practices if the <a href="https://my.ucdavis.edu/ask_us/">"Contact An Expert"</a> form on the UC Davis page. It is short and concise. It also has astericks to inform the user which fields are required to be filled. The question box is expandable as well, so you have as much room as you need to type out your request/question.  </p>
