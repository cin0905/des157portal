        <h2>Bunny in a flower patch - June 2, 2021</h2>
        <img src="images/bunny.jpg" alt="bunny">
        <p>These were my very first nails. I was mesmerized after they were finished, which led me to continue getting my nails done for the next two years. I saw these cute nails on “little Red book”, the equivalent of Pinterest in China. I love sage green and bunnies, so these nails were the perfect combination of both!</p>

        <h2>Cloudy Daydream - August 4, 2021</h2>
        <img src="images/cloud.jpg" alt="cloud">
        <p>These nails were also inspired from the little red book. I wanted to try out the color blue this time around. I found this cute image with clouds, hearts, and sparkles and knew this was what I wanted on my fingernails for the next month and a half.</p>

        <h2>UC Da-Vibes - September 19, 2021</h2>
        <img src="images/davis.jpg" alt="davis">
        <p>I got these nails right before I had to move to Davis for my first year on campus! The nails are inspired by Davis’ lush green fields, agriculture, and of course, COWS! A lot of people at school recognized my theme. People’s reactions to my nails are definitely part of the reason why I enjoy getting them done so much.</p>

        <h2>Techno Nails - November 22, 2022</h2>
        <img src="images/ae.jpg" alt="aespa">
        <p>These nails were a shift away from the cutesy nails I would always get the year prior. These nails are inspired by the K-pop group aespa. Their concept is futuristic AI, and these nails reflected those concepts well. </p>

        <h2>Sanrio Friends - February 24, 2023</h2>
        <img src="images/sanrio.jpg" alt="aespa">
        <p>These are the nails I currently have right now! I am a super fan of all things Sanrio and wanted to do a set completely dedicated to the cute characters. I love them, but to be honest the charms are quite a hassle. My hair constantly gets tangled on the ears of the characters. :( It’s nice to experience having charms on my nails but this may be my last time experimenting like this… </p>
