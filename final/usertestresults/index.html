    <h3>First User Test</h3>
    <p>While filling out the input boxes, the user got stuck on the "your date" box. They were unsure if a name was supposed to be inputted there or not. Otherwise, they completed the test pretty quickly. They provided some suggestions on improvements:</p>
    <p>1. Make the final output text larger</p>
    <p>2. Make the characters in the background move with animation</p>
    <p>3. Change the cursor to something else when clicking on the button</p>
    <p>4. Include audio</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Second User Test</h3>
    <p>The second user had some confusion when filling out the form. They were confused on what to put for "cuisine". Otherwise, it was pretty smooth sailing. A suggestion for improvement was breaking up the final text into two paragraphs so that it is less condensed.</p>

    <h3>Final Project Updates</h3>
    <p>User one gave me a lot of great suggestions that I will definitely implement. Both of the users commented on the final text pop-up. I will break it up into two paragraphs and make the text larger as well. To make the page more visually enhancing, I will also try out animating the characters to make it look like they are leaning in toward eachother in an embraceful kiss. I will also try out changing the cursor like user one suggested, and add audio when the submit button is clicked. In terms of the form submission, there has to be changes as both users had confusion throughout the process. I will change the "your date" to "your date's name". For "cuisine" I will change it to "cuisine (food)".</p>
