                This picture is interesting because it looks a bit odd at first glance. The picture is a drawing I made using gouache on paper. Since I used a black-and-white color scheme, the tone is very melancholy and sullen. The expression on the girl’s face also plays into those feelings as well. As with many pieces of art, everyone has their own interpretations of what they see. The piece is supposed to represent an eating disorder, symbolized by the fork, knife, and spoon being pointed at the girl’s eye in an almost threatening manner. My topic is centered around artwork I have made that holds deep meaning to me. This piece is a great example of that. My collection will take the viewer through different stages in my life and what I’ve experienced that has made me grow into the person I am today.

                This image is a sketchbook of multiple drawings of faces. The drawings are especially interesting because it seems she used continuous lines to draw the face. It’s visually enticing to my eyes as I try to decipher what features of the face the lines are making up. It gives it a more laid-back and gestural feel. I like how each person is very unique from the others and you can sense a personality through the fluidity of the pen strokes. The most obvious aspect would be that it is a page full of face sketches, the mystery lies in who exactly the faces are.

                Images and visuals are great supplements to any text. Some people digest information a lot more readily with the help of visuals to guide them. The strategies introduced in this reading are ones I will keep in mind when I start my Every Picture project. The photos should make the viewer become instrospective over the content on your page. A lot fo the strategies are one's that inspire thinking and reflection. Captioning the work is a great method to start a converstaion with the viewer. The article also made me realize that photos are also great additions for people who can't fluently read or understand english, it is a way for htem to still understand the content and be able to appreciate it. The website by <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/inspiration/unseen-world-unseen-studio">Unseen Studio</a> is a great example of great intersectionality between images and user interaction. You can view their projects while the background is a beautifully 3D rendered environment. The beautiful background makes you excited to interact and be on their site.

                In this detailed rundown on the do's and don't's of overlay use, author Whitenton provides plenty of wonderful examples that help the reader understand her points. I am more of a visual learner, and her breakdown with graphics was very insightful and helpful. I had never considered the affordances of overlays on user experience. I do recognize alot of the points made in this article. I have noticed that many websites will interject overlays that promote their company/products, which in the long run is quite annoying when you are browsing between sites. I can see how meaningful overlay is important to consider when making your webpage. I appreciate that the article lists down the steps you can go through to recognize whether or not your webpage requires an overlay or not. Much more of these questions are prompted when the device used in question is a cell phone. The small screen size makes it a lot more imperative to decide whether or not an overlay would be distracting. In my future projects, I will focus on the who, what, when, where, and why of my overlay decisions.

            The article was very insightful. I never considered the small intricate details that affect user experience when filling out a form. In my personal experience filling out forms, I tend to like it when they're straightforward and concise. Gathering the data from the article and my own personal experience will help me with my form designs. Some surprising things that came from the article were the tips about passwords and placeholder text. I never really bat an eye when I have to fill out those parts of a form, but the article made me realize how a simple change to the interface can drastically change user experience. I have always been annoyed with typing out the password two times, so implementing a show/hide bar is something that should be more widely accepted and used. The placeholder tip is more intuitive, but slight changes like that has an obvious affect on the visuals of the page and comprehension of the user. A form I have interacted with that I found exemplified best practices if the <a href="https://my.ucdavis.edu/ask_us/">"Contact An Expert"</a> form on the UC Davis page. It is short and concise. It also has astericks to inform the user which fields are required to be filled. The question box is expandable as well, so you have as much room as you need to type out your request/question.  </p>
